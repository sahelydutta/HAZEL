AI Personal Assistant - Hazel

Hazel is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to assist users in their everyday life. It leverages the power of natural language processing and machine learning to understand and execute user commands, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

Features:
- Voice Recognition: Hazel listens to user commands through the microphone and converts them into text using the speech recognition library. This allows for hands-free interaction and a more natural user experience.

- Speech Synthesis: Using the pyttsx3 library, Hazel has the ability to speak and provide auditory responses to user queries and commands. This enables a two-way communication channel between the user and the assistant.

- Wikipedia Integration: With a deep integration with Wikipedia, Hazel can quickly fetch information about a wide range of topics. By simply saying "Wikipedia" followed by the topic, Hazel searches the online encyclopedia and provides a summary of the relevant information.
